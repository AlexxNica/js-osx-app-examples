# JavaScript OS X App Examples

Starting with OS X 10.10, Yosemite you can use JavaScript to create native Cocoa
applications.

This is a collection of examples showing how to create many of the common components
used in OS X Applications. The goal is to help people learn how to build apps
by showing clear, atomic examples.

NOTE: You will need the OS X Yosemite Developer Preview to run any of the example
apps or edit their code.

### Running
You can run any of the example apps by double clicking them.

### Editing
To view and edit the code for each example you will need to use the Script Editor
application. It is located in Applications > Utilities > Script Editor. From there
you can either File > Open any of the example apps or drag the example app icon
to the Script Editor in the dock.
